Example Simple Water Quality Scatter Plots
================

## Example repo for TWRI staff and students

This repository provide some example scripts for producing simple time
series scatter plots of water quality parameters using TCEQâ€™s SWQM data
by TCEQ assessment units.

The `script.R` file is a long script that uses ggplot and associated
functions to produce figures showing *E. coli*, DO, NO<sub>3</sub>, and
TP measurements over time with a trend line fit over the data. There is
a lot of redundant code in this script file which can be the source of
errors when generating plots.

The `functionalized_script.R` accomplishes the same task in many fewer
lines by using more of a functionalized workflow and the `purrr`
package. Importantly, this reduces errors and speeds up data processing,
but requires a slightly more advanced understanding of R. The
`functionalized_script.R` could further reduce lines by iterating
functions that read and format data before plotting.

Installation instructions for packages that are required for these
scripts:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse","janitor", "ggtext", "ragg"))
install.packages("twriTemplates", repos = c(
 txwri = 'https://txwri.r-universe.dev',
 CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```
